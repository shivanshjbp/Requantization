RTL module implementing requantization logic.
Automatically generated by a high-level hardware description tool (name undisclosed).
Written in synthesizable Verilog.
Used in integer-only AI accelerators.
Essential in low-precision Transformers, e.g., for edge AI, embedded inference.
Appears between layers like attention, softmax, and MLP in quantized models
Reduces memory and compute requirements.
Crucial for deploying INT8 inference efficiently in hardware
